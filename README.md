The graph is layed out like this

evrytime you see a 0 it is either because the node doesn't connect
or it is the source node i.e A {0,4,5,0} it would be connected to B and C but not D

    //A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W
     {0,6,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, //A
     {6,0,5,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, //B
